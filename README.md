# lazyload

Lazyload images, iframes, divs, widgets untill they are visible in the viewport.

Pretty stable but still in alpha.
Battle tested against IE8+ Android Ch FF.

## Usage

```html
<!doctype html>
<script src="lazyload.min.js"></script>
<body>
  <!-- You should not lazyload first images of your website -->
  <img src="not/lazyloaded.jpg" />

  <img
    data-src="real/image/src.jpg"
    src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==
    onload=lzld(this) />

  <iframe
    data-src="yourpage.html"
    src="about:blank"
    onload=lzld(this)></iframe>
</body>
```

If you do not want to use a data-uri as your src, you can also use the provided [b.gif](b.gif) which is
the [tiniest gif ever](http://probablyprogramming.com/2009/03/15/the-tiniest-gif-ever).

On most websites, you better let the first top images not bound to lzld method.
So that they shows really fast.

## Options

Here are the options and defaults.
All parameters are optional.

```js
var myLzld = lazyload({
  container: document.body,
  offset: 200,
  src: 'data-src' // or function(elt) { return customSrc }
});
```

* **container**: Which element to be used as the `viewport`
* **offset**: When watched element is `offset`px near the viewport bounds, show it (horizontal, vertical)
* **src**: Where to find the real src of your element, either in another attribute (data-src) or
    using a custom function

## hidpi images

When giving a function to the `src` param, you can implement a custom src selector.
So you can handle resolution dependent

```html
<!doctype html>
<script src="lazyload.min.js"></script>
<script>
var lazyHd = lazyload({ src: hidpi });

function hidpi(img) {
  if(window.devicePixelRatio > 1) {
    return img.getAttribute('data-src-hd');
  }
}
</script>
<body>
  <img
    data-src-hd="images/src-hd.jpg"
    src="images/src-desktop.jpg"
    onload=lazyHd(this) />
</body>
```

Here you go! You are now loading a standard desktop image and loading the hd version when needed.
You could also load a blank image at start and choose either the desktop or hd version.

If your function does not returns anything special then the initial `src=` image will not be changed.

## Testing

Open `test/test.html` or use a headless browser:

```bash
# you may need to install phantomjs manually if you are on osx or windows
npm install -g mocha-phantomjs phantomjs
npm test
```

## Hacking

You need package.json dependencies and grunt.

```bash
npm install
npm install -g grunt-cli
grunt watch
```

Start an http-server in root dir:

```bash
npm install http-server -g
http-server
```

Open `test/test.html`, code, test.

## Building

We use closure compiler.

```bash
CLOSURE_PATH="~/path/to/compiler.jar" grunt
```

You get a `build/lazyload.min.js` file.

`compiler.jar` is [google closure compiler](https://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/downloads/list) .jar location.
