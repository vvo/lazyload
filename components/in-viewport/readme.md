# inViewport

Know when an element is in the window viewport or a custom viewport.

## Usage

### Immediate result

```js
var elem = document.getElementById('myFancyDiv');

var isInViewport = inViewport(elem); // returns `true` or `false`

alert('myFancyDiv is ' + isInViewport ? 'visible' : 'not visible' + ' in the window');
```

### Using a callback

We watch for your element to enters the viewport and call your callback when it does.

```js
var elem = document.getElementById('myFancyDiv');

inViewport(elem, visible);

function visible(elt) {
  alert(elt.id + ' is visible in the window !');
}
```
The first callback argument is always the elt that entered the viewport.

### A custom container

By default, we use the current window as the reference viewport.
But you can also specify another element as a reference viewport.

```js
var customContainer = document.getElementById('myFancyContainer');
var elem = document.getElementById('myFancyDiv');

inViewport(elem, { container: customContainer }, visible);

function visible() {
  alert('myfancyDiv is visible in the `customContainer` !');
}
```

### Specifying an offset

By default, when your element precisely enters the viewport, you get a callback / true result.
But maybe you want to know when your element is soon to be shown in the viewport.
Use an `offset` param for that !

```js
var elem = document.getElementById('myFancyDiv');

inViewport(elem, { offset: 300 }, visible);

function visible() {
  alert('myfancyDiv is visible in the `customContainer` !');
}
```

When your element is near `300px` of the viewport, you get your callback / true result.

## Use cases

* lazyloader (images, iframes)
* infinite scroll
* loading widgets only when needed
* your ideas

## Testing

Open `test/test.html` or use a headless browser:

```bash
npm install -g mocha-phantomjs phantomjs
npm test
```

## Hacking

You need package.json dependencies and grunt.

```bash
npm install
npm install -g grunt-cli
grunt watch
```

Start an http-server in root dir:

```bash
npm install http-server -g
http-server
```

Open `test/test.html`, code, test, GOTO code.

## Building

```bash
CLOSURE_PATH="~/path/to/compiler.jar" grunt
```

You get a `build/in-viewport.min.js` file.

`compiler.jar` is [google closure compiler](https://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/downloads/list) .jar location.
